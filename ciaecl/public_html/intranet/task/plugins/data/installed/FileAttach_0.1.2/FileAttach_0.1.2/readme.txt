- New tab in task view mode 'Files'
- New icon in general view for indicating available files next to comments icon
- New table containing Filename, Description, Size, Datetime, Author(Owner)
- New folder for storing the files, probably /files(configurable via config.php)
- Allowed extensions list (configurable via config.php)
- Files stored under their DB id, when downloaded, link generated from DB Filename field
- Same user permissions as comments

IMPORTANT:
Existing table (frk_itemFile) in default installation has been reused.
If you know what you're doing, modify it manually.
If not or just want an easy installation, just drop the table before you begin
(can be done during installation as an option)

Check config.php for additional settings
Create /files folder with write permissions in your TaskFreak! root folder
