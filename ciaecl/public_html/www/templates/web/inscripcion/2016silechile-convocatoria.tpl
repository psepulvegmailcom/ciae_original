  <strong>Paul van den Broek</strong> is professor in Cognitive and Neurobiological Foundations of Learning and Teaching at Leiden University, the Netherlands, and director of the Brain and Education Lab. He obtained his PhD from the University of Chicago (1985), and was professor at the University of Kentucky (1985-1987) and the University of Minnesota (1987-2008) before moving to the Netherlands.
