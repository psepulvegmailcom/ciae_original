		<p>Monet's devotion to painting out of doors is illustrated by the famous story concerning one of his most ambitious early works, Women in the Garden (Mus&#233;e d'Orsay, Paris; 1866-67).

		<p>Russian-born French painter. Born to a humble Jewish family in the ghetto of a large town in White Russia, Chagall passed a childhood steeped in Hasidic culture.</p>
		<p>Very early in life he was encouraged by his mother to follow his vocation and she managed to get him into a St Petersburg art school. Returning to Vitebsk, he became engaged to Bella Rosenfeld (whom he married twelve years later), then, in 1910, set off for Paris, 'the Mecca of art'.</p>
		<p>He was a tenant at La Ruche, where he had Modigliani and Soutine for neighbours. His Slav Expressionism was tinged with the influence of <a href="http://www.artchive.com/artchive/D/daumier.html">Daumier</a>, Jean-Fran&#231;ois Millet, the Nabis and the Fauves.</p>
		<p>He was also influenced by <a href="http://www.artchive.com/artchive/cubism.html">Cubism</a>. Essentially a colourist, Chagall was interested in the Simultaneist vision of Robert Delaunay and the Luminists of the Section d'Or.</p>

		<p>Pablo Picasso, born in Spain, was a child prodigy who was recognized as such by his art-teacher father, who ably led him along.</p>
		<p>The small Museo de Picasso in Barcelona is devoted primarily to his <a href="http://www.artchive.com/artchive/P/picasso_early.html">early works</a>, which include strikingly realistic renderings of casts of ancient sculpture.</p>
		<p>He was a rebel from the start and, as a teenager, began to frequent the Barcelona cafes where intellectuals gathered.</p>
		<p>He soon went to Paris, the capital of art, and soaked up the works of Manet, Gustave Courbet, and <a href="http://www.artchive.com/artchive/T/toulouse-lautrec.html">Toulouse-Lautrec</a>, whose sketchy style impressed him greatly. Then it was back to Spain, a return to France, and again back to Spain - all in the years 1899 to 1904.</p>
